# Acceleration-based-user-authentication-system-with-MATLAB

# Code Files: Contains training, testing, and optimization scripts for three domains (Frequency Domain, Time Domain, and Combined Frequency-Time Domain).
# Dataset of 10 users: Includes acceleration-based feature sets for 10 users across three domains (Frequency Domain with 43 features, Time Domain with 88 features, and Combined Frequency-Time Domain with 131 features). Each domain has data for two days: First Day (FDay) and Multiple Days (MDay).
# Descriptive Statistics Graphs: Illustrates data analysis using intra-user and inter-user variance to identify stable and discriminative features for authentication.
# Code Runner: Provides an example script to run the complete training, testing, and optimization process for the Frequency Domain. You can adapt it for other domains.
# Train and Test Templates: Separate folder with pre-prepared training and testing templates for each user and domain, facilitating seamless model evaluation.
